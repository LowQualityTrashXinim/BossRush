FasterTerraria is a mod that make boss drop a custom treasure chest within the mod
The aim of this mod is make player progression become much faster and allow player to only build arena to fight boss as soon as possible
Another aim of this mod is allow player to replay this mod endlessly without feeling every playthrough feel like the same play through

This mod have been designed so that player can play the mod without grinding, and is designed to be play with other mod or play at your own pace
Any plan that force player to play a certain way is never consider nor to be in the mod, this mod allow player to play however they want to

If player want to play the way as the mod intended then here are ground rule for it :
-Only use item that given to player by Treasure Chest
-Avoid building house for NPC (digging hole to keep npc in place is allow)
-Enable Synergy Mode on (so that player can get synergy weapons and accessories)
-Build arena using the amount platform that is given to player from Treasure Chest
-Fight boss as soon as you done building arena for boss
-Only fight or refight the boss with the amount of spawner that is given to player
-Enraged boss is intended to be fight like normal boss progression, fighting it with better gear than it is not intended

Planning :
-add more synergy energy weapon
-possible end mod boss
-rework loot drop depend on future feedback ( only take more feedback after synergy update out )
-Add spawner for mini boss

it should be working in multiplayer, if it not do tell me, the normal/journey mode will definitely have issue with TreasureChest drop rate, i haven't able to fix it cause i haven't test it out
