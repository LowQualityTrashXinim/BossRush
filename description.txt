Disclaimer: This game is in a beta state. While this mod is playable until Moon Lord, it's contents are unpolished, unfinished and aimless.

Roguelike Terraria is a challenging mod that offers an entirely new experience built around having just one life. Make it count!
• Strategise your way to Moon Lord using fairly randomised yet limited resources.
• Contruct thousands of possible builds using brand new interactive systems affecting both the player and their weapons.
• Customize your experience via various configurations.
